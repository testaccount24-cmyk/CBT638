 INSTALLATION GUIDE
 ==================
 The package contains two programs:
   Program  Source   Description
   ======== ======== ==============================================
   EMAILENC HLASM    Encoding files with BASE64 or Quoted Printable
   SENDMAIL REXX     Read SYSIN and ATTACH to prepare SMTP email.

 Prerequisites
 =============
   The SENDMAIL package is based on OS/390 TCP/IP SMTP services.
   Please refer Following IBM Manual to implement SMTP service:

   Chapter   : Configuring the SMTP Server
   Book Title: IBM Communications Server: IP Configuration Guide
   Document  : SC31-8725

 Installation Procedures
 =======================

 I. Customize Assembler Program EMAILENC

    The encoding algorithm Quoted Printable for text data will
    use EBCDIC to ASCII translation table. The default translation
    table is Canadian Bilingual CECP Code Page 037. If you require
    different translation table. You need to copy and paste the
    translation table to following location of the source program:
    starting from following DS statement:

    E2ATAB   DS 0CL256

    The translation table can be found in your installation at:
    TCPIP.SEZATCPX

    Contact your system administrator for the source translation
    table for following default binary table:
    TCPIP.STANDARD.TCPXLBIN

    Do not copy the ASCII to EBCDIC translation table.

 II. Compile Assembler Program EMAILENC

    This program is re-entrent 31 bit mode program. You should use
  RENT parm in link editor. Here is the sample JCL to compile this
  program:

    //COMPILE EXEC ASMACL,PARM.L='LIST,RENT'
    //C.SYSIN   DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SP2487.ASM.SOURCE(EMAILENC)
    //C.SYSLIB  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.MACLIB
    //          DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.MODGEN
    //L.SYSLMOD DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.USER.LINKLIB
    //L.SYSIN   DD *
      NAME EMAILENC(R)
    /*

   The target load library can be in your system LINKLST or LPA list.
   To refresh the LINKLST, issue following MVS command:
      F LLA,REFRESH

   Or, you can edit the member COMPILE and submit it.

 III. Customize REXX program SENDMAIL

   The REXX program SENDMAIL will interpret the SYSIN and ATTACH
   DD, and prepare email body and attachements for SMTP service.
   Please refer the member @USERGDE for the usage of SENDMAIL.

   The SENDMAIL program is required to customize to meet your
   system environment. Edit the program SENDMAIL and locate at
   following statement:

    Init_Main:

   Follow this statement, there are 6 variables need to be customized:

   SenderEmail
   -----------
     SenderEmail tell SMTP server which email address to be
     used in SENDFROM field. This email address should be
     generic email address representing your mainframe.

    Example:
      SenderEmail  = '"Mainframe System" <hostname@company.com>'

   SMTP_Writer
   ----------
     SMTP Wirter Name. Refer to your SMTP configurations.
     The default is SMTP.
   Example:
     SMTP_Writer  = 'SMTP'

   SMTP_Class
   ----------
     SMTP output class, Refer to your SMTP configurations.
     The default is B
   Example:
     SMTP_Class   = 'B'

   TimeZone
   --------
     The time zone of your system.
     The default is EST
   Example:
     SMTP_Class   = 'EST'

 IV. Install REXX Program SENDMAIL
    The REXX program should be installed in your TSO command libarary.
  such as SYS1.CLIST.
     Copy the member SENDMAIL from this installation library to your
  TSO command library.


 V. Check list for installation

   ==== ==========================================  ============
    1.  Implement your SMTP server                  ______

    2.  Cusomize Translation Table in EMAILENC      ______

    3.  Compile the encoding program EMAILENC       ______
        LOADLIB Dataset Name (in LINKLST)           ___________________

    4.  Cusomize the SENMAIL REXX program values    ______

    5.  Install SENDMAIL REXX program               ______
        REXXLIB Dataset Name (used in SYSEXEC)      ___________________

 VI. Test the SENDMAIL program

  Refer the member @USERGDE for syntax of ATTACH and SYSIN DD.
  The JCL batch syntax is:

  // job card here
  //SENDMAIL EXEC PGM=IKJEFT01,PARM=SENDMAIL
  //* If the EMAILENC is in LINKLST, remove STEPLIB
  //*STEPLIB  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.USER.LINKLIB
  //SYSEXEC  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.USER.REXXLIB
  //SYSTSPRT DD  SYSOUT=*
  //SYSTSIN  DD  DUMMY
  //ATTACH   DD  *
    attachment statements
  /*
  //SYSIN    DD  *
