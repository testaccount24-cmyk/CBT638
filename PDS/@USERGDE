 USER GUIDE
 ==========

 The SENDMAIL program is designed for Mainframe OS/390, z/OS systems.
 All the mail will be sent via TCP/IP SMTP mail server.
 Please refer the installation guide for the SMTP customization
 information.

 Syntax of JCL
 =============
 E-mail messages are given through SYSIN DD.
 All attachments are given through ATTACH DD.
 If the EMAILENC is in LINKLST, remove STEPLIB DD.

 Syntax of SYSIN DD
 ==================
 The program will just read the column 1-72, the column 73-80 will be
 ignored.

 The SYSIN DD have two sections: Header and Body.

 Email Header
 ------------
   Header is from the first line to the line begin with Subject:
   There are 4 keywords supported:
     1. "From:" The Email address to send email from (Optional).
              The default address is TSOID@hostname.domain.name

     2. "To:" The email list for sending this email to (Madatory).
              One email address must be in single line
              The email address syntax is :
                 "name" <email.address>
              The <email.address> is mandatory and "name" is optional.
              Multiple addresses are continued by ',' or ';' or space.
              Example 1:
              To: "my friend1" <my.friend1@his.company.com>

              Example 2:
              To: "my friend1" <my.friend1@his.company.com>,
                  "my friend2" <my.friend2@his.company.com>,
                  "my friend3" <my.friend3@his.company.com>

     3. "Cc:" The email list for copying this email to (Optional).
              The syntax of email address is the same as To:

     4. "Bcc:" The email list for copying this email with hide (Optional)

   The body supports HTML tags.
   You may provide your own signature at the end of body.

   Example 1: Simple version.
     Dear Friend,
     This is a sample email send to you from mainframe.
     Please ignore this email as it's a test one.

     Thanks

     Hunter

   Example 2: HTML version:
     Dear <B><I>Friend</I></B>,
     This is a sample email send to you from <font size="+1">
     mainframe</font>.

     Please ignore this email as it's a test one.

     <I>Thanks<I>

     <B>Hunter</B>


 Syntax of ATTACH DD
 ===================
  This is a text file to instruct SENMAIL batch to send the attachments.
  You can send multiple attachments in this DD.
  ATTACH DD is optional. If you don't code this DD, there will be
  no attachment in the email batch.

  The file must be sequential file (QSAM) in catalog.
  Supported Files:
   .Sequential file (QSAM)
   .PDS member
   .GDG files: The GDG generations is allowed.
   .DD  Name:  You can specify DD Names  to be attached in the email,
               The DD name must be pre-allocated in submit JCL.

  According to SMTP standard RFC 1521, the attchements will be encoded
  depending on their formats:

    Format Encoding Algorithm       Sample data
    ====== ================== ========================================
    TEXT   Quoted Printable   Any plain text, source code
    BINARY Base64             Images, program readable data (zip,doc...)

  You must correctly specify the format of each attachment, otherwise
  the receivers will not get what they want.

  Guidelines in ATTACH DD
  -----------------------
    Please follow following guidelines while preparing this DD:
    1. Any lead or tailed space(' ') will be ingored.
    2. Any text beyond '#' will be comments.
    3. Each attachment will have a separate section leaded by
       keyword ATTACHMENT:
    4. There are four sub-keywords for each attachment:
       'DATASET     =' One of following dataset name:
            .Sequential file (QSAM)
            .GDG file
            .PDS member
            .DD Name, pre-allocated DD name in JCL.
            This statement is mandatory.
       'RENAME      =' The new name to be used in e-mail.
            You may use this field to specify the common name in emails
            such as: Report.txt, Summary.txt, Install.Package.zip.
            This statement is optional.
       'FORMAT      =' The format of the dataset:
            Format Encoding Algorithm       Sample data
            ====== ================== =============================
            TEXT   Quoted Printable   Any plain text, source code
            BINARY Base64             Images, program readable data
            This statement is optional (TEXT is default)
       'DESCRIPTION =' The description shown in e-mail. (optional)
            This statement is optional.
    5. If there is no attachment DD, the email batch will ignore this
       file, and just sent the e-mail message defined in SYSIN DD.

  Examples for ATTACH DD
  ----------------------

    Example 1: Single attachment
     //ATTACH DD  *
     #--Begin--
     Attachment:
       Dataset      = SYS1.USER.JCL(SENDMAIL)
       Rename       = Sample SENDMAIL JCL.txt
       Format       = text
       Description  = The sample JCL for send email from mainframe
     #--end--
     /*

    Example 2: Multiple attachments
     //ATTACH DD  *
     # Attachement No. 1
     Attachment:
       Dataset      = SYS1.RMF.REPORT(0)
       Rename       = Latest RMF Report.txt
       Format       = text
       Description  = The Latest System Performance Report
     # Attachement No. 2
     Attachment:
       Dataset      = SYS1.RMF.REPORT.PARM
       Rename       = System Report Parameters
       Format       = text
       Description  = The parameters for RMF report
     #--end--
     /*

    Example 3: Single attachment via DD Name
     //OUTPUT DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.RMF.REPORT(0)
     //ATTACH DD  *
     Attachment:
       Dataset      = OUTOUT
       Rename       = Sample SENDMAIL JCL.txt
       Format       = text
       Description  = The sample JCL for send email from mainframe
